  <!-- ## Acceptance Criteria
    ```
    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
    WHEN I open the planner
    - THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    - THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours (bootstrap input boxes/cards, just have to handle 9-5)
    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    
    - THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    - THEN I can enter an event (form input)
    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    - THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
    - THEN the saved events persist
    ??? functions ???
    saveHandler - we need a function to handle click and save
    displayCurrentTime - get current date and time and put it on the page (Moment.js)
    renderColorCode - use moment.js (or alternatives in webapi) to get the current time "color code" (class and background-color)
    renderCells - onLoad functions? or when the page is ready, we need to "render" any saved cells (defer document-ready? jquery timeout) (edited)

    ??? functions ???
    WHEN I search for a city (form input, maybe some buttons)
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    (displayCurrentWeather func - ($.ajax) api call and also displays current weather for city and saves the city)
    (renderSavedCities func - render all saved city buttons onLoad (when the document is ready - defer), also render the last city)
    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index (see activity 5)
    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe (use the API doc / google) 
    (getUVClass func - process the UV index and return a class - background-color)
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
    (display5Day func - ($.ajax) api call for forecasts, render the 5 days with icons for weather conditions)
    WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
    (buttonClickHandler func - (console.log(event.target)) handles click events for the generated city buttons, should render the 5-day forecast and current weather)
    WHEN I open the weather dashboard
    THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast (see the first functions) (edited)  -->
